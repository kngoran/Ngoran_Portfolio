## [Project 1:  Decision Tree Specialty Coffee Case Study](https://github.com/kngoran/SpringBoardProjects/blob/master/%20Decision%20Tree%20Specialty%20Coffee%20Case%20Study.ipynb)

Imagine you've just finished the Springboard Data Science Career Track course, and have been hired by a rising popular specialty coffee company - RR Diner Coffee - as a data scientist. Congratulations!

RR Diner Coffee sells two types of thing:

specialty coffee beans, in bulk (by the kilogram only)
coffee equipment and merchandise (grinders, brewing equipment, mugs, books, t-shirts).
RR Diner Coffee has three stores, two in Europe and one in the USA. The flagshap store is in the USA, and everything is quality assessed there, before being shipped out. Customers further away from the USA flagship store have higher shipping charges.


## [Project 2: Regression: The Red Wine Dataset](https://github.com/kngoran/SpringBoardProjects/blob/master/%20Regression%20Case%20Study-the%20Red%20Wine%20Dataset.ipynb) 

Welcome to the Unit 8 Springboard Regression case study! Please note: this is Tier 3 of the case study.

This case study was designed for you to use Python to apply the knowledge you've acquired in reading The Art of Statistics (hereinafter AoS) by Professor Spiegelhalter. Specifically, the case study will get you doing regression analysis; a method discussed in Chapter 5 on p.121. It might be useful to have the book open at that page when doing the case study to remind you of what it is we're up to (but bear in mind that other statistical concepts, such as training and testing, will be applied, so you might have to glance at other chapters too).

## [Project 3 Predict Employees Attrition and Retention Using Classification algorithm](https://github.com/kngoran/SpringBoardProjects/blob/master/Capstone%20Project%202%20Employees'%20Turnover%20%26%20Retention2.ipynb)

Many organizations have found that turnover is a very costly problem. Turnover is a process in which employees leave an organization. Employees leave the company voluntarily or involuntarily. In either way, companies have to replace them. The extent to which employers face turnover rates and the cost often varies by organizations and industries. Depending on the organization or industries, management has to pay particular attention to the turnover rate since it can reduce the productivity and loss of clients that affect the company's long-run bottom line. In this project, we will try to uncover the key variables that contribute to employees' turnover.
