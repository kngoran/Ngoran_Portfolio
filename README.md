## [Project 1:  Decision Tree Specialty Coffee Case Study] 

Imagine you've just finished the Springboard Data Science Career Track course, and have been hired by a rising popular specialty coffee company - RR Diner Coffee - as a data scientist. Congratulations!

RR Diner Coffee sells two types of thing:

specialty coffee beans, in bulk (by the kilogram only)
coffee equipment and merchandise (grinders, brewing equipment, mugs, books, t-shirts).
RR Diner Coffee has three stores, two in Europe and one in the USA. The flagshap store is in the USA, and everything is quality assessed there, before being shipped out. Customers further away from the USA flagship store have higher shipping charges.
